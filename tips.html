      <p class="text">If you are battling depression or just being lazy, you might find it challenging to complete the
        simplest of tasks to invest in your wellbeing. Behavioural activation is one intervention that can help to
        combat this, therefore there is a weekly schedule down below to ensure it becomes more manageable. </p>

      <p class="text">Reading has been shown to put our brains into a state similar to meditation, and it brings the
        benefits of deep relaxation and inner calm. Regular readers sleep better, have lower stress levels, higher
        self-esteem, and lower rates of depression than non-readers. </p>

        Research show that music releases dopamine, the feel-good chemical in your brain. According to the findings
        people reassess 9% higher dopamine when they listen to music that they enjoyed. It may not be obvious to us, but
        there is a strong link between music and mental wellbeing. Music speaks when the words fail.
